								<h3>Call for Main Track Contributions</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is the most prestigious international forum for presenting research results in the field of dependable computing.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Authors are invited to submit original papers on the research and practice of creating, validating, deploying, and maintaining dependable systems and networks.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							All aspects of dependability and applied security are within the scope of DSN, including innovative architectures, protocols, and algorithms, as well as experimentation with and assessment of dependable and secure systems. DSN’s current thematic areas of emphasis are:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, system on chip, storage systems, trusted computing)</li>
								<li>Software (e.g., applications, middleware, operating systems)</li>
								<li>Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, medical systems)</li>
								<li>Socio-technical systems (e.g., virtual worlds, human-computer interaction, social networking)</li>
								<li>Clouds (e.g., cloud storage, computing, platforms, applications)</li>
								<li>Networks (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, intrusion detection systems, network security)</li>
								<li>Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, and assessing dependable systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis)</li>
							</ul>
