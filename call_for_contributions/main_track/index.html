								<h3>Call for Main Track Contributions</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is the most prestigious international forum for presenting research results in the field of dependable computing.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Authors are invited to submit original papers on the research and practice of creating, validating, deploying, and maintaining dependable systems and networks.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							All aspects of dependability and applied security are within the scope of DSN, including innovative architectures, protocols, and algorithms, as well as experimentation with and assessment of dependable and secure systems. DSN's current thematic areas of emphasis are:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, system on chip, storage systems, trusted computing)</li>
								<li>Software (e.g., applications, middleware, operating systems)</li>
								<li>Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, medical systems)</li>
								<li>Socio-technical systems (e.g., virtual worlds, human-computer interaction, social networking)</li>
								<li>Clouds (e.g., cloud storage, computing, platforms, applications)</li>
								<li>Networks (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, intrusion detection systems, network security)</li>
								<li>Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, and assessing dependable systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis)</li>
							</ul>

								<h3>Information to authors</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Innovative papers in other areas of dependable and secure systems and networks will also be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference favors work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art implementations. Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, correctness and impact.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2016, if accepted.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							For more details about submission, and for submission, visit the Submission page (coming soon).

								<h3>Paper Categories</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Submissions can be made in one of the following categories (authors are required to indicate the category as part of the title):
							</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Regular papers (max. 12 page submission; 12 pages in proceedings): full paper describing a research contribution to dependable computing, including experimental work focused on implementation and evaluation of existing dependability techniques.</li>
							<li>Practical experience reports (max. 8 page submission; 8 pages in proceedings): a short paper describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and techniques to real-world problems.</li>
							<li>Tool descriptions/demonstrations (max. 8 page submission; 8 pages in proceedings): descriptions of the architecture, implementation and usage of substantive tools to aid the research and practice of dependability.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The number of pages indicated above includes everything: title page, text, references, figures, appendices, etc.</p>

								<h3>Anonymizing Rules</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their paper. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. For example, a paper on experiences with the design of .NET should not be re-written to be about "an anonymous but widely used commercial distributed systems platform."
							</p>
							<p>Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page</li>
							<li>Remove acknowledgement of identifying names and funding sources</li>
							<li>Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.</li>
							<li>Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work.</li>
							<li>If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: "Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2014]." with the corresponding citation: "[Anonymous 2014] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing."</li>
							<li>If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chair in a separate email.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated above) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded.</p>

								<h3>Paper Submissions</h3>
							</p>
							<p>Papers are submitted via the <a href="http://cs-hotcrp.unine.ch/hotcrp/dsn2017/">submission website</a>.</p>
							<p>The program committee will perform double-blind reviewing of all submissions, with limited use of outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.</p>
							<p>Authors must anonymize their submissions (see below for guidelines). Submissions violating the formatting andanonymization rules will be rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.</p>
