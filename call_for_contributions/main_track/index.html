								<h3>Call for Main Track Contributions</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is the most prestigious international forum for presenting research results in the field of dependable computing.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Authors are invited to submit original papers on the research and practice of creating, validating, deploying, and maintaining dependable systems and networks.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							All aspects of dependability and applied security are within the scope of DSN, including innovative architectures, protocols, and algorithms, as well as experimentation with and assessment of dependable and secure systems. DSN's current thematic areas of emphasis are:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, system on chip, storage systems, trusted computing)</li>
								<li>Software (e.g., applications, middleware, operating systems)</li>
								<li>Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, medical systems)</li>
								<li>Socio-technical systems (e.g., virtual worlds, human-computer interaction, social networking)</li>
								<li>Clouds (e.g., cloud storage, computing, platforms, applications)</li>
								<li>Networks (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, intrusion detection systems, network security)</li>
								<li>Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, and assessing dependable systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis)</li>
							</ul>

								<h3>Information to authors</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Innovative papers in other areas of dependable and secure systems and networks will also be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference favors work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art implementations. Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, correctness and impact.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2016, if accepted.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							For more details about submission, and for submission, visit the Submission page (coming soon).
