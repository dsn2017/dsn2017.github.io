								<h3>Call for Workshop Contributions</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							DSN strives to be a conference that welcomes both researchers and practitioners, and hence we  would like to have a number of workshops that provide different opportunities for collaborating and exchanging information. These include:
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Workshops that address hot topics and open challenges;</li>
								<li>Workshops that give researchers a forum to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas at a stage before they have matured to warrant conference or journal publication;</li>
								<li>Workshops that provide practitioners and researchers with working sessions to discuss and make progress toward solutions to current issues in dependability;</li>
								<li>Workshops that focus on enabling discussions and information sharing between researchers and industrial practitioners</li>
							</ul>

								<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							DSN is interested in workshop topics that represent either complementary areas to the main conference or a large, active subarea. Topics from recent DSN workshops include (alphabetical order):
							</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Adaptive and Mobile Unbiquitous System Dependability</li>
								<li>Analysis of Reliability and Security Data</li>
								<li>Clouds, Data Centers, Virtual Machines and Containers' Dependability</li>
								<li>Cyber-physical Systems Dependability</li>
								<li>Dependability Assessment of Complex Systems</li>
								<li>Dependable and Secure Nanocomputing</li>
								<li>Dependability and Security of System Operation</li>
								<li>Dependability Issues in Software Defined Networks</li>
								<li>Fault Tolerance for Extreme Scale Systems</li>
								<li>Resilient Computing</li>
								<li>Safety and Security of Intelligent Vehicles</li>
								<li>Trustworthiness of Smart Grids</li>
							</ul>

								<h3>Acceptance and Publication</h3>
							</p>
							<p>
							Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the workshop's potential for generating useful results, the timeliness of and expected interest in the topic, and the proposers' ability to lead a successful workshop.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Accepted workshops will have a two-page proceedings-format summary (generated by the workshop organizers) published in the Main Proceedings of the conference. Written contributions to the workshop itself (summaries, short papers, etc.) will be included in the Supplement to the DSN Proceedings as well as in the DSN-W volume on IEEE Xplore. The workshop web pages will be linked through the main DSN website <a target="_tab" href="www.dsn.org">(www.dsn.org)</a> and the call for papers will be advertised through the DSN mailing lists.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Organizers are expected to perform any additional advertising in related communities outside the main DSN community, to create and maintain the workshop website, arrange for the collection and refereeing of submissions, and to co-ordinate the collection and delivery of camera ready material and IEEE copyright transfers.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Please submit all workshop proposals by <b>November 4th, 2016</b>, preferably as a PDF file, via e-mail to <b>workshops_2017@dsn.org</b>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Workshop proposers will be notified of the outcome of their submission by <b>November 25th, 2016</b>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The timelines for submissions to the accepted workshops will be communicated directly to the proposers.
							</p>
