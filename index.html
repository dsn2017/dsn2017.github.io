		<h2><img src="DSN2014Logo.jpg" alt="Denver" style="width:10%;height:100px;">The 47th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks</h2>
		
		  <h3>24-27th June 2017, Denver,Colorado,USA</h3>
		  
		  <p>The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is the 
		  most prestigious international forum for presenting research results in the field of dependability
		  and security.</p>
		  
		  <p>The rapidly expanding Information Technologies (IT) increasingly form the basis of all imaginable 
		  and novel emergent application paradigms, with the technical aspects being as important as the growing 
		  socio-economical and societal values.</p>
		  
		  <p>Dependability and security aspects are essential, as both the society and individuals rely more and more 
		  on the services delivered by IT. Coping with attacks and unintentional faults in a rapidly evolving technological 
		  and application environment generates new challenges for the dependability and security community thus 
		  driving DSN.</p>
		  
		  <p>DSN is now in its fifth decade of evolution and has a sustained tradition to address both conceptual and applied
		  research results related to actual questions posed by the rapid IT evolution. This flagship dependability conference
		  addresses the entire spectrum of scientific and technological challenges which are indispensable to  solve for 
		  partaking the benefits of modern IT.</p>
		  
		  <p>DSN 2013 aims at offering a value focused program including plenary talks, regular papers, experience reports, panels, 
		  student forum, fast abstracts, demonstrations of tools and technologies, debate sessions, together with state-of-the-art 
		  workshops and tutorials. The tradition of offering a high quality program assumes the contribution of the leading researchers
		  and we look forward to your participation!</p>
