				<p><b>William H. Sanders</b></p>

				<p>"For the Assessment-driven Design of Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructures for Electrical Systems"</p>

					<p>A leading cybersecurity expert, the groundbreaking contributions of William H. Sanders have made the electric power grid more safe, secure, reliable, and available. He did so by developing tools and techniques to make the grid more resilient to attacks that may occur as well as method for assessing its cyber security and resiliency. He has worked in every part of the field, from the distribution-side, including smart meters, to long-haul transmission networks. Among other contributions, he is the co-developer of NP-view software to test NERC-CIP compliance process and control networks, which has changed the way utilities audit their networks.</p>

					<p>An IEEE Fellow, Dr Sanders is a Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Engineering and Head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA.</p>
