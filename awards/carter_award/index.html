							<b>Award Presentation</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								The IEEE TC on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance and IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance are jointly announcing the William C. Carter PhD Dissertation Award in Dependability. Previously known simply as the William C. Carter Award, it has been presented annually since 1997 to recognize an individual who has made a significant contribution to the field of dependable computing through his or her graduate dissertation research.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Since 2016, the award has been changed to a dissertation award with nominations to be made by the nominee's PhD advisor. A special committee will evaluate all nominations made in the current year and choose the award recipient. The award recipient will receive a $2000 US cash award, and a waived registration fee to attend the edition of the IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) at which the award is presented. The recipient will be required to attend DSN to receive the award and will be invited to give a short presentation to DSN attendees.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							To be eligible for the award, the nominee's PhD defense must be completed prior to the nomination deadline and must have occurred no more than 16 months prior to the nomination deadline. A candidate can be nominated only one time. Nominations will be due on March 5, 2017.
							</p>

							<b>About Wlliam C. Carter</b>
							</p>
							<p>
Bill Carter's career spanned over four decades, from programming, debugging, and recovery in ENIAC, through reliability, availability and serviceability during the evolution and definition of IBM mainframes. In particular, he took great interest in the future of the field and was instrumental in promoting the work of young contributors. It was characteristic of Bill to take the initiative in reaching out to students and younger colleagues. The William C. Carter Award is intended to honor and carry on his legacy.							</p>
