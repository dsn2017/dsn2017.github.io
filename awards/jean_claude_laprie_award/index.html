							<b>Award Presentation</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Dr. Jean-Claude Laprie was Directeur de Recherche at LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse, France. He devoted his entire career to research on the dependability of computing systems. His unique capability of abstraction and formalization, and his contributions to the formulation of the concepts and methodologies of dependability, rapidly led to national and international recognition. He received the IFIP Silver Core in 1992, the Silver Medal of French Scientific Research in 1993, and the Grand Prize in Informatics of the French Academy of Science in 2009. He was made Chevalier de l'Ordre National du M&eacute;rite in 2002.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The IFIP 10.4 working group on Dependable Computing created the award in his honor in 2011. It recognizes outstanding papers that have significantly influenced the theory and/or practice of Dependable Computing.

							<b>This Year's Jean-Claude Laprie Award Winning Papers</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								This year, IFIP Working Group 10.4 announced that two outstanding papers have been selected as winners of the 2017 Jean-Claude Laprie Award in Dependable Computing:
							</p>
							<p>
							<ul>
							<li>Kuang-Hua Huang and Jacob A. Abraham, <b>"Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance for  Matrix Operations"</b>, in IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. C-33, No. 6, pp. 518-528, June 1984</li>
							<li>Richard Schlichting and Fred Schneider <b>"Fail-Stop Processors: An Approach to Designing Fault-Tolerant Computing Systems"</b> in ACM Transactions on Computing Systems, 1(3), Aug. 1983, pp. 222-238. </li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The paper <b>"Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance for  Matrix Operations"</b> by Kuang-Huang and Jacob A. Abraham has formed the basis for an entire new domain of research within the umbrella of dependable computing over the last 30 years. Huang and Abraham’s paper was the first proposing an effective mathematical technique for algorithm level fault tolerance in matrix operations, showing that data could be encoded with very low overhead and provide effective error detection and correction. Since matrices are in the heart of many computation-intensive operations, this technique has been widely used and has inspired significant research work on algorithm based fault tolerance in other computing domains and applications. This outstanding paper has not only stood the test of time, keeping an extensive impact on dependable computing research and practice, but it has also seen its relevance increased year after year, as can be attested by the growing number of its citations.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The outstanding paper <b>"Fail-Stop Processors: An Approach to Designing Fault-Tolerant Computing Systems"</b> by Richard Schlichting and Fred Schneider proposed the fail-stop abstract failure model and defined a formal approach to building fault-tolerant software using this abstraction. The clean failure semantics of the fail-stop model facilitates the building of fault-tolerant software in a distributed system by raising the level of abstraction and greatly simplifying the failure behavior assumption the system designer has to address, moving away from arbitrary failure models and focusing on the simple detection of the cessation of activity by the processor. Schlichting and Schneider’s paper has significantly influenced subsequent research work that has developed fail-stop model utilizations or proposed model approximations, originating variants of the silent failure behavior such as the fail-fast and fail-safe.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Authors of the winning papers will be presented the award on June 27, 2017 in Denver, CO, USA, during the opening session of the Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN – www.dsn.org)).

					<h3>About IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance</h3>
					</p>
					<p>
					IFIP Working Group 10.4 was established by the IFIP General Assembly in October 1980, and operates under IFIP Technical Committee TC-10, "Computer Systems Technology". Its charter is to identify and integrate approaches, methods and techniques for specifying, designing, building, assessing, validating, operating and maintaining computer systems so that justified reliance can be placed on the service they deliver, i.e., systems that are reliable, available, safe and/or secure.
