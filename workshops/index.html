								<h3>The 3rd International Workshop on Safety and Security of Intelligent Vehicles (SSIV)</h3>
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Organizers</b>

							Over the last years, aerial and ground vehicles as well as mobile robot
systems have been receiving an increased number of electronic components,
connected through wireless networks and running embedded software. This
strong integration between dedicated computing devices, the physical
environment and networking, composes a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). CPS
have thus become part of common vehicles, accessible to everyone, such as
automobiles or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, as processing
power increases and software becomes more sophisticated, these vehicles
gain the ability to perform complex operations, becoming more autonomous,
efficient, adaptable, comfortable, safe and usable. These are known as
Intelligent Vehicles (IV). This will be the third edition of the workshop,
aiming at continuing the success of previous editions. The workshop will
keep its focus on exploring the challenges and interdependencies between
security, real-time, safety and certification, which emerge when
introducing networked, autonomous and cooperative functionalities.

								<h3>Recent Advances in the DependabIlity AssessmeNt of Complex systEms (RADIANCE)</h3>
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Organizers</b>
							<ul>
							<li>Ariadne Maria B. Rizzoni, Carvalho, University of Campinas, SP, BR <br/> ariadne@ic.unicamp.br</li>
							<li>Nuno Antunes, University of Coimbra,PT<br/>nmsa@dei.uc.pt</li>
							<li>Andrea Ceccarelli, University of Florence,IT<br/>andrea.ceccarelli@unifi.it</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							In this 3rd edition, the RADIANCE workshop has a renewed commitment to
discuss novel dependability assessment approaches for complex systems and
to promote their adoption in real-world systems through industrial and
academic research.
The increasing pervasiveness and size of software systems, the use of
software off-the-shelf, the adoption of loosely-integrated and composable
services and microservices, and the advent of the Internet of Things come
to exacerbate the increasing complexity of the systems. This calls call for
new solutions for the efficient, automated, and possibly continuous
assessment and certification.
RADIANCE will promote and foster discussion on novel ideas, constituting a
forum where researchers can share both real problems and innovative
solutions for the assessment of complex systems.

								<h3>Whether Argumentation Works (WAW 2017)</h3>
							</p>
							<p><font color="red"><b>CANCELLED!</b></font></p>
							<p>
							<b>Organizers</b>
							<ul>
							<li>Patrick J. Graydon, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, US <br/> patrick.j.graydon@nasa.gov</li>
							<li>C. Michael Holloway, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, US <br/>c.michael.holloway@nasa.gov</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							As the use of assurance cases has expanded, researchers have
increasingly stressed the role of explicit argument. Yet while safety
cases are broadly thought effective, the literature offers neither a
precise definition of what it means for assurance argumentations to work
nor empirical evidence that they do.  The first workshop on Whether
Argument Works (WAW) invites short position papers and will feature a
moderated audience discussion.  Participants will collaborate to (1)
enumerate the goals and purposes of the various forms of assurance
argument, (2) define testable hypotheses that capture what it means for
arguments to "work," and (3) propose, critique, and refine designs for
appropriate studies and experiments.

								<h3>The 3rd International Workshop on Dependability Issues in SDN and NFV(DISN)</h3>
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Organizers</b>
							<ul>
							<li>Matti Hiltunen,AT&T Labs Research, Bedminster, NJ, US<br/>hiltunen@research.att.com</li>
							<li>Elias P. Duarte Jr.,Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, PR, BR<br/>eliasufpr@gmail.com</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are two technologies that have already had a deep impact on computer and telecommunication networks. SDN and NVF introduce numerous dependability challenges. In terms of reliability, the challenges range from the design of reliable new SDN and NFV technologies to the adaptation of classical network functions to these technologies. The effective, dependable deployment of the virtual network on the physical substrate is particularly important. In terms of security, the challenges are enormous, as SDN and NFV are meant to be the very fabric of both the Internet and private networks. Threats, privacy concerns, authentication issues, and isolation - defining a truly secure virtualized network requires work on multiple fronts.
