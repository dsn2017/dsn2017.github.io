												<p>The organizers of the DSN conference announce the availability of student travel grants to partially offset the cost of students planning to attend DSN-2016 in Toulouse, France, June 26 - June 29, 2017.</p>

					<p>To be eligible, the applicant must be enrolled in a degree program at the time of DSN-2017. The student authors of accepted research papers or students submitting papers to the Student Forum are all especially welcome to apply. Participation, such as authoring a regular paper, will be used as a priority criterion in awarding the grants.</p>

					 <p>We anticipate awarding grants (possibly as full or part student registration waivers) thanks to the generous support of IEEE and IFIP organizing the conference series.</p>

					<p>Questions or comments about Student Travel Grants should be directed to DSN Student Travel Grant Committee at: lijun.chen@colorado.edu</p>

					<p>To apply, <b>submit by email a write-up not exceeding 100 words</b> stating your student status and summarizing your current research related to 		dependable computing, what you hope to learn by attending the conference, and how you expect it to affect your future research directions. Ability to summarize is a quality of a good researcher, therefore too long a statement will be to the applicant's disadvantage.</p>
					
					
					<p>
					<b>Also include, at the front of your submission</b>, in this order:
					<ul>
					<li>Your name, university name, and preferred contact e-mail address</li>
					<li>Your postal address, and telephone number</li>
					<li>Your paper category (regular, practical experience report, student forum)</li>
					<li>Your paper title</li>
					<li>Your current student status and degree program that you are in (BS / MS / MS+PhD / PhD)</li>
					<li>Your thesis advisor's/supervisor's name</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Applications must be received no later than June 20, 2017. Application submission is via e-mail, preferably as a PDF attachment, to the following address: lijun.chen@colorado.edu. All submissions will be confirmed via return e-mail within 48 hours of receipt.</p>
