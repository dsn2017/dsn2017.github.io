								<h3>Abstract</h3>
								<p>Fault injection has been an extensively researched and well-explored topic in the DSN community. However, today there is no easy framework that allows ordinary developers and testers to inject both hardware and software faults, in a customizable fashion. In our group at UBC, we have been developing one such framework called LLFI over a number of years now (<a href="https://github.com/DependableSystemsLab/LLFI">github link</a>). LLFI is based on the popular open-source LLVM compiler, and allows fault injection to be combined with program analysis techniques. This allows targeted injection of faults into specific program constructs and data, and easy correlation of the fault injection results with the program's code. LLFI can inject both hardware and software faults, and has been used in a wide variety of fault injection studies (both in our group and elsewhere). LLFI has been designed to be easy to use and has both a GUI, and command-line scriptable interface. It also has a domain-specific language (FIDL) for writing new fault injectors with the framework.</p>
								<p>This tutorial will teach the audience the basics of LLFI, the design philosophy and how to use it. We will start by learning to perform simple fault injection experiments for both hardware and software faults using LLFI. We will also explore how to interpret the results of the fault injection experiments and use them in real-world case studies. Finally, we will delve into the internals of LLFI and learn how to write new fault injectors using the FIDL language, and the APIs of the framework.</p>

								<h3>Tutorial 2:  A practical view of modeling and quantification of network survivability </h3>
								Presenter: <p>Prof. Poul E. Heegaard, (poul.heegaard@ntnu.no) NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), Department of Information Security and Communication Technology</p>
<p>Prof. Kishor S. Trivedi (ktrivedi@duke.edu) Pratt School of Engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Duke University</p>

								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>The goal of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to the concept and definition of survivability and to demonstrate approaches to model and quantify survivability in networks. In our tutorial we define survivability as the "ability to provide services in compliance with the requirement even in presence of major and minor failures in network infrastructure and service platforms caused by undesired events that might be external or internal". The network survivability is quantified as defined by the ANSI T1A1.2 committee, which is the transient performance from the instant an undesirable event occurs until steady state with an acceptable performance level is attained. Examples are taken from the survivability of mobile networks and virtual connection over an IP network as well as from smartgrid. </p>
							</p>
							
							<p>After an introduction to survivability and the modelling framework for quantification of survivability, the tutorial will present an exercise with example from a 5G mobile system. The objective with the exercise is to provide useful insight and experience with the use of an analytic tool (Sharpe), and programming of a discrete event simulator.</p>
							<p>Tentative time schedule (6 hours including breaks)</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Introduction of concept and framework (90 min)</li>
									<li>Break (15 min)</li>
									<li>Tool: Sharpe (20 min)</li>
									<li>Tool: DEMOS (20 min)</li>
									<li>Introducing the exercise (20 min)</li>
									<li>Lunch (45 min)</li>
									<li>Work in groups (120 min)</li>
									<li>Present and discuss solution (30 min)</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p>
							As a full-day tutorial (6 hours): both analytic and simulation exercises.   [preferred] <br/>
							As a half-day tutorial (3 hours): only analytic exercise.  
							</p>
							
							<p>
							The tutorial is in the area of: 
Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, and assessing dependable and secure systems: (performance, dependability and security evaluation; analytical and numerical methods; simulation; experimentation; benchmarking; verification; field data analysis; data mining techniques)
with hands-on exercises using analytic (and simulation) tools. </p>
