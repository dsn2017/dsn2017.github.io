								<h3>Abstract</h3>
								<p>Fault injection has been an extensively researched and well-explored topic in the DSN community. However, today there is no easy framework that allows ordinary developers and testers to inject both hardware and software faults, in a customizable fashion. In our group at UBC, we have been developing one such framework called LLFI over a number of years now (<a href="https://github.com/DependableSystemsLab/LLFI">github link</a>). LLFI is based on the popular open-source LLVM compiler, and allows fault injection to be combined with program analysis techniques. This allows targeted injection of faults into specific program constructs and data, and easy correlation of the fault injection results with the program’s code. LLFI can inject both hardware and software faults, and has been used in a wide variety of fault injection studies (both in our group and elsewhere). LLFI has been designed to be easy to use and has both a GUI, and command-line scriptable interface. It also has a domain-specific language (FIDL) for writing new fault injectors with the framework.</p>
								<p>This tutorial will teach the audience the basics of LLFI, the design philosophy and how to use it. We will start by learning to perform simple fault injection experiments for both hardware and software faults using LLFI. We will also explore how to interpret the results of the fault injection experiments and use them in real-world case studies. Finally, we will delve into the internals of LLFI and learn how to write new fault injectors using the FIDL language, and the APIs of the framework.</p>
